As you can see I added an area for the player to choose their spaceship so I used a sprite sheet and I divide up the sprite sheet up to correspond with what spaceship the player chose (kinda like the cat running animation project). But, the sprite sheet was showed up really small so the icons were tiny. Honestly, I should've used another sprite sheet because whoever made this sprite sheet made it so that once you ran it in the program it would be really small and I had to manually resize (which I did for the spaceship choosing screen) but for the actual gameplay it was sizing properly but I think the rect was only sizing so there would be a black portion near the tiny icon.

For the final version I just resorted to making indivual image files for each spaceship and just accessed those in the code because I couldn't find a solution to the problem other than this. Feel free to email me if you figure it out. Also, I added lasers which the player could shoot and they would "destroy" the asteroid when in reality just moving it to the top of the scren. And, I added a backstory which is that the player is trying to get into the prestigious Elite Space Adacemy and this is the entrance test. A score of 50 and less results in a fail while 51 and higher results in acceptance.
